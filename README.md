## Work Experience
**Data Scientist. Intellidane Cybernetics (_September 2020 - November 2022_)**
- Developed and implemented proprietary algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning models and some statistics indicators.
- I used analytical findings to influence the decision of the strategy to use in implementing proprietary algorithmic trading strategies.
- Developed a machine Learning model that predicts pneumonia severity either high severity or mid severity or low severity using neural network, MLP, Random forest.
- I performed a predictive analysis applying a machine Learning model that predicts several cryptocurrency prices, forcast financial market movement.
- Frequently imported, inspected, cleaned, and transformed data with regard to the business goals of the company using Python. Excel and PowerBi to prepare reports and dashboards.
- Developed a machine Learning model that predicts several cryptocurrency prices using LSTM for the prediction and using Random Forest for the classification of either to buy or sell.

**Freelance Data Scientist/Analyst (_December 2022 - Present_)**
- I developed and implemented compelling dashboard using data to tell a story and generate key data points insights For an HR company.
- Developed a reinforcement learning for network intrusion detection system using NSL_KDD dataset.
- I developed an image classification using CIFAR-10 datasets.
- I developed a machine learning model to detect mental health among teenagers.
- I interpreted, analyzed and presented the analysis of my data results.
- I developed and designed an interactive dashboard for a software product that shows insights on customer usage.

  
## Projects
### Weapon Detection ("https://github.com/akindele22/weaponCV.git")
Developed a machine Learning model built with Tensorflow libraries that detect weapons(knives, matchet ) using inceptionv2, Restnet101,Restnet50.

### Apple's Green House Emission

I analyze and design a dashboard that shows how Apple has reduced their emission from 2015 to 2022, I also analyze how this trend compare to their revenue and market capital trend in the same period.

### Inventory Management Dashboard
I designed a compelling dashboard on inventory management based on ABC analysis and XYZ analysis in inventory management system. ABC analysis is a method in which inventory is divided into three categories, i.e A,B and C in descending value. The items in the A category have highest value, B category items are of lower value than A, and C category items have the lowest value. XYZ analysis is a way to classify inventory items according to the variability of their demand or derived/forcasted consumption. XYZ analysis can be used to plan material requirements and inventory levels so that waste, production delays, or excessive inventory levels can be avoided. I use DAX to create a  measure for the analysis.
