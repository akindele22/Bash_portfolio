### Inventory Management Dashboard
I designed a compelling dashboard on inventory management based on ABC analysis and XYZ analysis in inventory management system. ABC analysis is a method in which inventory is divided into three categories, i.e A,B and C in descending value. The items in the A category have highest value, B category items are of lower value than A, and C category items have the lowest value. XYZ analysis is a way to classify inventory items according to the variability of their demand or derived/forcasted consumption. XYZ analysis can be used to plan material requirements and inventory levels so that waste, production delays, or excessive inventory levels can be avoided. I use DAX to create a  measure for the analysis.
